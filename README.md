# atom-mdn-search

I can't get Atom's `apm` to work, so I'm not able to publish this package at the moment.
Since Microsoft is ending support for Atom, I'm not sure how much effort I want to put into this.

If you want this functionality for now, paste the code from `just-use-this-for-now.js` into atom's `init.js`.
